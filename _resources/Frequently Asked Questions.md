<summary>What is the 15 Million Years of Healthy Life Social Movement?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the world,
averaging 85 years, but spend the 10 years in poor health. The challenge
now is to not only add more years to life, but those years to be lived
as fully as possible and in good health – physically, mentally, and socially.</p>
<p>The Adding 15 Million Years of Healthy Life (15M) Movement aspires for
our residents to live as many of their years in good health as possible,
both delaying the onset of serious illness and improving quality of life,
ensuring that residents not only live longer but also healthier lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We aspire for each of the 1.5 million residents living in Central and
North Singapore to regain the 10 years typically spent in ill health. In

<p>Health is social. Social determinants impact 80% of health outcomes compared

motivating and supporting and sustaining the behaviour change critical
for transforming our communities and healthcare.</p>
