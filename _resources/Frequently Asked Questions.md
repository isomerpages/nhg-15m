<summary>What is the 15 Million Years of Healthy Life Social Movement?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Singaporeans live among the longest in the world to an average of 85 years,
yet they typically spend the last 10 years in poor health. The National
Healthcare Group (NHG) hopes to regain as many of those 10 years as possible
for each of our 1.5 million residents in Central and North Singapore as
its Regional Health Manager. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 15 Million Years of Healthy Life (15M) Social Movement aims to rally
the community to take stronger ownership of their health, aligned with <em>Healthier SG</em> and <em>Age Well SG</em>.We
have thus set <strong>Adding 15 Million Years of Healthy Life</strong> as
our aspirational goal for our residents to live more of their life-years
in good physical, mental, and social health so that they can enjoy what
matters to them for longer.</p>
<p>NHG will support the 15M Social Movement through its commitment to medical
care and innovations for its residents. But this challenge calls for a
collective effort of residents, community partners, GPs, and organisations
in Central and North Singapore. This effort will drive the 15M Social Movement
by activating and supporting residents not as individuals but as groups
and communities for health; find among themselves stories of health and
social activation that inspire and contribute to building a better society;
support residents to proactively connect and act together with one another
for better health; and extend support to those who need it more.</p>

<summary>How does the movement plan to achieve 15 million years of healthy life?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The key call of the 15M Social Movement is “<strong>Me to We</strong>”
– from attaining my own health by myself to acting together with others
for the health of all.</p>

social connectedness, and partnering with community groups, active ageing
centres, workplaces, and schools, the movement creates a supportive environment
for healthier lifestyles and stronger communities.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What does “healthspan” mean in the context of this movement?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Healthspan refers to the number of years a person lives in good health,
free from serious illness or disability. The movement focuses on improving
the healthspan, not just lifespan, by fostering healthier habits and stronger
community connections.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Why is social connectedness important?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Health is social. Social determinants impact 80% of health outcomes compared
to 20% effect of medical care. Social connections have strong effects for
motivating and supporting and sustaining the behaviour change critical
for transforming our communities and healthcare.</p>
