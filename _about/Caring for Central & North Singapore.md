<h2>NHG’s Population Health Campus</h2>

<p>
<br>PHC anchors the care for our residents with a full range of healthcare
services across <strong>Primary Care</strong>, <strong>Community Care</strong>,
and <strong>Population Health Management</strong>. These services include
NHG Polyclinics, Central-North Primary Care Network, NHG Community Health
Teams, NHG Preventive Health Centre, NHG Telehealth &amp; Call Centre,
NHG Digital Health Services, NHG Pharmacy, and NHG Diagnostics.</p>
<p>Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the world at
85 years but spend the last 10 years in poor health. In collaboration with
our private general practices, community health and social care providers,
we aim to keep residents well and healthy, as well as enable residents
to care for their own wellbeing.&nbsp;Together, we hope to empower our
residents to regain the 10 years typically spent in ill health, collectively
adding 15 million years of healthy life.</p>
