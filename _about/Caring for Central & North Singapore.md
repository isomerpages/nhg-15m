<h2>NHG’s Population Health Campus</h2>
<p>The <strong>Population Health Campus (PHC)</strong> of National Healthcare
Group (NHG) is NHG’s commitment to add years of healthy life for the 1.5
million residents of Central and North Singapore, as Regional Health Manager.
PHC synergises our collective efforts across Primary Care, Community Care,
and Population Health, turning the whole region into a campus for health,
in close collaboration with our NHG hospitals, specialty centres, polyclinics,
GPs and community providers. Together, as a Population Health Collective,
we join up healthcare services, integrate health and social care, support
preventive health and enable ageing well in place. As a collective, we
also support the social movement for residents to connect and act together
for health as caring communities, to not just have longer lives, but healthier
and happier lives with their loved ones.</p>
