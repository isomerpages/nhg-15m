<h2>NHG’s Population Health Campus</h2>
<p>The Population Health Campus (PHC) brings together NHG’s population health
efforts as the fourth campus covering the Central and North region. It
is NHG’s commitment to add years of healthy life for our 1.5 million residents.​</p>

<p>
<br>PHC anchors the care for our residents with a full range of healthcare
services across Primary Care, Community Care, and Population Health Management.
These services include NHG Polyclinics, Central-North Primary Care Network,
NHG Community Health Teams, NHG Preventive Health Centre, NHG Telehealth
&amp; Call Centre, NHG Digital Health Services, NHG Pharmacy, and NHG Diagnostics.</p>
<p>Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the world at
85 years but spend the last 10 years in poor health. In collaboration with
our private general practices, community health and social care providers,
we aim to keep residents well and healthy, as well as enable residents
to care for their own wellbeing.&nbsp;Together, we hope to empower our
residents to regain the 10 years typically spent in ill health, collectively
adding 15 million years of healthy life.</p>
<p>Medical care is vital, but it only accounts for 20% of health outcomes.
The remaining 80% is affected by social determinants, including social
connectedness. The 15M Movement aims to shift the focus of health from
‘<strong>Me’ to ‘We’ </strong>– from attaining my own health by myself,
to acting together with others for the health of all.</p>
<p>We aspire for residents in communities as families, friends, neighbours,
colleagues, schoolmates, interest groups to grow as <strong>caring communities </strong>that
support each other’s well-being and health.</p>
<p>Let’s connect and act together to add 15M years of healthy life!</p>
