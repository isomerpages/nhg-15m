<h2>NHG’s Population Health Campus</h2>
<p>The NHG Population Health Campus (PHC) brings together NHG’s ​population
health efforts as the ‘fourth campus’ to better serve our 1.5 million assigned
residents.As a ‘campus’ that covers the whole of Central and North Singapore,
PHC partners our hospital campuses, specialty centres, GPs and community
providers, to join up care, integrate health and social care, take a preventive
health strategy and support ageing in place.</p>
