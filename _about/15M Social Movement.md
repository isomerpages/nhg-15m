<h2>What is the 15 Million Years of Healthy Life (15M) Social Movement?</h2>
<p>National Healthcare Group (NHG) cares for the population of 1.5 million
residents of Central and North Singapore as the Regional Health Manager
(RHM).&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><strong>1.5 million residents x 10 years</strong></h1>
</blockquote>
<p>In caring for the health of all residents in Central and North, and not
just patients, NHG goes beyond running hospitals and polyclinics. NHG collaborates
with private general practices, community health and social care providers,
to keep residents well and healthy, as well as enable residents to care
for their own wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Medical care is vital, but it only accounts for 20% of health outcomes.
The remaining 80% is affected by social determinants, including social
connectedness. The 15M Movement aims to shift the focus of health from
‘<strong>Me’ to ‘We’ </strong>– from attaining my own health by myself,
to acting together with others for the health of all.</p>
<p>We aspire for residents in communities as families, friends, neighbours,
colleagues, schoolmates, interest groups to grow as <strong>caring communities </strong>that
support each other’s well-being and health.</p>
<p>Let’s connect and act together to add 15M years of healthy life!</p>
