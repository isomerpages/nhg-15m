<h2>What is the 15 Million Years of Healthy Life (15M) Social Movement?</h2>
<p>Staying socially connected to those around you has shown to bring health
benefits. The 15M Social Movement aims to bring together the residents
of Central and North Singapore to act together for each other’s health.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><strong>1.5 million residents x 10 years</strong></h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Shifting the focus of health from ‘<strong>Me’ to ‘We’</strong>, the 15M
Social Movement aspires for residents in communities as families, friends,
neighbours, colleagues, schoolmates, interest groups to grow as <strong>caring communities </strong>that
support each other’s well-being and health.</p>
<p>Let’s connect and act together to add 15M years of healthy life!</p>
