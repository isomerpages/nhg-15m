<h2>What is the 15 Million Years of Healthy Life (15M) Social Movement?</h2>
<p>Social movements bring together the collective power of the people to
bring about change​. The 15M Social Movement is a call for residents in
communities, as families, friends, neighbours, schoolmates, colleagues,
interest groups, to connect and act together for each other's health.​
The rallying call is not just to reclaim for ourselves the 10 years typically
spent in poor health, but 15 million years together, for all 1.5 million
residents in Central and North​ Singapore. Together, we aim to build and
grow many caring communities.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1><strong>1.5 million residents x 10 years</strong></h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Shifting the focus of health from ‘<strong>Me’ to ‘We’</strong>, the 15M
Social Movement aspires for residents in communities as families, friends,
neighbours, colleagues, schoolmates, interest groups to grow as <strong>caring communities </strong>that
support each other’s well-being and health.</p>
<p>Let’s connect and act together to add 15M years of healthy life!</p>
