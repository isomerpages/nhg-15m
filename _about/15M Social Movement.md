<h2>What is 15M Social Movement?</h2>
<p>This 15M social movement calls for residents in communities, as families,
friends, neighbours, schoolmates, colleagues, interest groups, to connect
and act together for each other's health.</p>
<p>This rallying call is not just to reclaim for ourselves the 10 years typically
in poor health, but 15 million years together and for all 1.5 million residents
in Central and North.</p>
<p>The aim is to build and grow many caring communities where residents support
each other for well-being and health, to continue to work and aspire towards
adding 15 million years of healthy life.</p>
<h2>Be a part of the movement!</h2>
