<h4>Caring communities are formed when we get together with those around us to act together for each other’s health. Happening from <u>1 – 28&nbsp; February 2025</u>, connect with your family, friends and other in your community,&nbsp; set a health goal together, and tell us more about how you are coming together and motivating each other to meet this goal. Stand a chance to win vouchers for your group when you take part in the 15 Million Years of Healthy Life Social Challenge today.</h4>
