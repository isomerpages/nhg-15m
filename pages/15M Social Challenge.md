<h4><strong>Challenge period extended to 4 June 2025!</strong></h4>
<p>You asked for more time, we listened! Caring communities grow stronger
when we come together to support each other's health journey. That's why
we've extended the challenge period – to give more people the opportunity
to join in, forge meaningful connections, and work towards better health
together.</p>
<p>From 4 April – 4 June 2025, stand a chance to win vouchers when you connect
with your friends, family, neighbours, schoolmates, colleagues, set a health
goal together, and tell us more about how you are coming together and motivating
each other to meet this goal.</p>

<p>Get together to set a joint health challenge and support each other to
reach the goal – these goals can vary from cooking a balanced nutritious
meal for neighbour, invite your <em>kakis</em> to take a walk, pick up a
new sport together, quit smoking together or even keeping each other accountable
for going for health check-ups regularly.</p>
